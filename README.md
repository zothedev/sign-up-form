This is a basic sign-up form created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. [This](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/afdbabfab03fbc34783c6b6f3920aba4a4d3b935/intermediate_html_css/forms/project_sign_up_form/imgs/sign-up-form.png) was the design image I used when creating the website.

This project shows my understanding of form controls and styling - a vital aspect of web design. Overwhelming or unappealing sign-up forms beg your new users to leave. A clean and simple form design is very important.
